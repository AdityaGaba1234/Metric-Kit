Great questions! Here’s a clear explanation of how MetricKit works in your app, how often didReceive(_:) is called, and how it fits into real-world apps. I’ll also describe a visualization you could build to show MetricKit’s flow.

1. How does MetricKit deliver metrics?
MetricKit is a system framework. It collects metrics in the background for your app.
You register as a subscriber (usually in your main view controller or AppDelegate) using MXMetricManager.shared.add(self).
The system delivers metrics to your app at most once every 24 hours (not every launch, not every minute).
When metrics are ready, iOS wakes your app in the background (even if it’s not running) and calls your didReceive(_:) method with an array of MXMetricPayload objects.
2. How often is didReceive(_:) called?
Usually once per day per device, per app.
If your app is used heavily, it might be called more than once, but never more than once per 24 hours for metrics.
If your app is not opened for days, the next time it’s opened, you may get several payloads (one per day) in a single call.
Diagnostic payloads (for crashes, hangs, etc.) may be delivered more frequently, but metrics are daily.
3. Where does MetricKit call didReceive(_:)?
Not through AppDelegate. It’s called on whatever object you registered as a subscriber (in your code, your ViewController).
Not through every function. Only the subscriber’s didReceive(_:) is called, and only by the system.
You can register any class that conforms to MXMetricManagerSubscriber.
4. How does this work in real apps?
In production, you usually register a singleton or a service class (sometimes in AppDelegate, sometimes in a dedicated metrics manager).
You process and store the metrics, send them to your backend, or analyze them for performance improvements.
MetricKit is passive: it does not interfere with your app’s normal flow.
5. Visualization: How MetricKit Works
Here’s a simple flowchart you can use to visualize the process:

flowchart TD
    A[App Launches] --> B[App Registers as MXMetricManagerSubscriber]
    B --> C[App Runs Normally]
    C --> D[System Collects Metrics in Background]
    D --> E[~24h Passes]
    E --> F[iOS Delivers Metrics]
    F --> G[didReceive(_:) Called on Subscriber]
    G --> H[App Handles/Logs/Uploads Metrics]


Key points:

Metrics are collected by the system, not your code.
Delivery is scheduled by iOS, not by your app.
Your app only needs to handle the didReceive(_:) callback.


6. If you build a real app:
You can keep this sample code for logging and debugging.
For production, you might want to:
Store metrics locally or upload to your server.
Analyze trends over time.
Alert on regressions (e.g., high memory, slow launch).
Visualize metrics in your own dashboard.

8. Extra: How to Visualize in Your App
You could add a chart (e.g., using Charts library) to show:

Number of payloads received per week
CPU/memory/network usage trends
Histogram of launch times (when available)
In summary:

MetricKit is system-driven, passive, and delivers data at most once per day.
didReceive(_:) is only called by the system, not by your app logic.
You can visualize and analyze the data as you wish, but you can’t control when it arrives.
