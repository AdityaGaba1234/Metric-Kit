# MetricKit Demo App 📊

A comprehensive iOS demo application showcasing Apple's MetricKit framework for collecting and analyzing app performance metrics.


## 🎯 What is MetricKit?

MetricKit is Apple's framework that provides standardized, privacy-preserving metrics about your app's performance and power usage. It collects data on-device and delivers aggregated metrics to help you understand how your app performs in real-world conditions.

## 🔧 How MetricKit Works

### Data Collection
- **Automatic**: MetricKit automatically collects metrics while your app runs
- **Privacy-First**: All data is aggregated and anonymized on-device
- **Daily Delivery**: Metrics are delivered once per day (approximately every 24 hours)
- **Background Processing**: Collection happens without impacting app performance

### Metric Types Collected

1. **CPU Metrics** 🖥️
   - Cumulative CPU time used by your app
   - CPU instruction counts
   - Helps identify CPU-intensive operations

2. **Memory Metrics** 💾
   - Peak memory usage
   - Average suspended memory
   - Memory footprint analysis

3. **Disk Metrics** 💿
   - Cumulative logical writes
   - Storage I/O patterns
   - Disk usage optimization insights

4. **Display Metrics** 📱
   - Average pixel luminance
   - Display-related power consumption

5. **Application Time Metrics** ⏱️
   - Foreground vs background time
   - Background audio time
   - Background location time

6. **Launch Metrics** 🚀
   - Time to first draw
   - Launch performance histograms
   - Cold vs warm launch analysis

7. **Responsiveness Metrics** ⚡
   - App hang time histograms
   - UI freezes and stutters
   - User experience quality

8. **Network Transfer Metrics** 🌐
   - WiFi upload/download
   - Cellular data usage
   - Network efficiency analysis


## 🆕 July 2025 UI/UX Update

- Redesigned dashboard with large, multi-row action buttons for easier access and better readability
- Animated refresh loader in navigation bar for clear feedback during data updates
- Increased chart heights and improved layout for better data visualization
- Enhanced touch feedback and visual polish for all controls

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- All dashboard actions are now grouped in clear sections: Simulation, Analysis, and Data Controls
- Refresh logic prevents duplicate loads and shows a loading spinner in the navigation bar
- Charts and stats update smoothly with new data

## 📱 App Features

### Main Interface
- **Real-time Logs**: View detailed metric payloads as they arrive
- **Statistics**: Track metrics count and app uptime
- **Professional UI**: Clean, terminal-style display for technical data

### Controls
- **Clear Logs**: Reset the log display
- **Simulate Work**: Generate CPU and memory activity to trigger metrics
- **Export Logs**: Share logs via iOS share sheet

### Detailed Logging
- Comprehensive metric breakdown with emojis for easy reading
- Formatted timestamps and durations
- Human-readable memory and time formats
- Histogram data visualization for performance metrics

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Core Setup
```swift
// 1. Import MetricKit
import MetricKit

// 2. Conform to MXMetricManagerSubscriber
class ViewController: UIViewController, MXMetricManagerSubscriber

// 3. Register as subscriber
MXMetricManager.shared.add(self)

// 4. Implement metrics receiver
func didReceive(_ payloads: [MXMetricPayload]) {
    // Process metrics here
}
```

### Key Components
- **MXMetricManager**: Central manager for metric collection
- **MXMetricPayload**: Container for all metrics data
- **Various Metric Types**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, etc.

## 📈 Understanding Metrics

### When Metrics Arrive
- **Daily Schedule**: iOS delivers metrics approximately every 24 hours
- **App Launch**: Sometimes delivered when app launches after metrics period
- **Background**: Can arrive while app is backgrounded

### Interpreting Data
- **Cumulative Values**: Most metrics show total values over the measurement period
- **Histograms**: Performance data broken down into time buckets
- **Averages**: Mean values over the measurement period

### Real-World Usage
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track CPU and memory usage trends
2. **Battery Optimization**: Analyze power-hungry operations
3. **Launch Performance**: Optimize app startup times
4. **Network Efficiency**: Monitor data usage patterns
5. **User Experience**: Identify and fix app hangs

## 🧪 Testing the App

### Generating Test Data
1. **Use "Simulate Work"**: Triggers CPU-intensive and memory operations
2. **Use the App Normally**: Regular usage generates metrics
3. **Wait for Delivery**: Metrics typically arrive within 24 hours

### What to Expect
- Initial runs may not show metrics immediately
- Metrics reflect aggregated data from previous sessions
- More data appears with continued app usage

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Common Issues
- **No Metrics**: Normal for new apps or first-time runs
- **Delayed Delivery**: Metrics follow iOS system schedule
- **Incomplete Data**: Some metrics only available under specific conditions

### Best Practices
- Run app regularly to generate baseline data
- Use on actual device (not simulator) for real metrics
- Keep app installed for several days to see meaningful data

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Custom Metric Categories
- App-specific performance indicators
- Custom measurement periods
- Filtered metric analysis

### Integration with Analytics
- Export data to external analytics platforms
- Automated performance monitoring
- Trend analysis and alerting
